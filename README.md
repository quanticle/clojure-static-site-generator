# Clojure Static Site Generator

This is a simple static site generator that takes a directory tree of Markdown files and turns them into HTML. The objective is to keep things as simple as possible, even if that means sacrificing a certain amount of functionality.

## Dependencies

* [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) for templating
* [InstaParse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse) for parsing markdown
